# Portfolio
My Current (2023) portfolio. This is constantly being added to, to showcase my most recent work.

### Paws and Claws Pet Shop
Made in html, css and javascript. Originally a piece of work from my Foundation apprenticeship, we were tasked with choosing a subject that our employers gave us. We were to ask questions to our client and make a template for a website to the clients agreement.

### Quiz
Made in Python. Using a read command to read and write out the questions and collect the amount of correct answers the player gets.

### Text Editor GUI
Created using Python. A simple text editor that allows you to open files already in your computer and edit them or create a new file. All files are markdown as this is intended to be a place I can write notes as I develop it and I write all of my notes in markdown.

### Notification
Made in python. Sends a reminder straight to my desktop to remind me to commit to my repo and make my daily logs for university.

### Calendar GUI
Made in python. To be added into the text editor.
